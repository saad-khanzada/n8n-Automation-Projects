#  n8n Automation Projects by Saad

A curated collection of **AI-driven automation workflows** built with [n8n](https://n8n.io/), leveraging **Gemini API**, **Supabase**, and various Google integrations.  
These projects demonstrate how intelligent automations can simplify communication, enhance productivity, and integrate AI reasoning into real-world workflows.
